# alyssa-lis624
**For spring 2026, lis 624**
what you have set up so far,
what this repo will contain,
or what you learned during this process.

This repo will contain
1. important info for my classwork
2. changes made on my server
3. helpful shortcuts, tips, and nano commands

#### I have learned to keep thorough documentation during this process. Each time I work in the server, exit it, then reopen, my history from my last open is not shown. So, I need to make sure to include the changes I used and commands I sent on this repo to keep track of my progress. If I make a mistake, I can easily reference this doc to see where I went wrong.
